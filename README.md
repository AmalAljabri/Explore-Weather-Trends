# Explore Weather Trends â›…

In this project, I analyzed local in Riyadh and global temperature data and I compared the temperature trends local in Riyadh and global temperature trends. I built a website through which the user chooses his city and shows it the city's data. The data is processed and the moving average of the user's city and the world is calculated, and his line chart is displayed and allowed to write his observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends and then save the web page as a PDF file. It is was implemented using SQL, Python language, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit under Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity!
